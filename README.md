# Gravitational Friction

This repository contains a text file presenting an analysis of the **Hubble Law** derived from first principles, exploring **gravitational friction** as a potential mechanism. The dataset comprises distance measurements obtained via different astrophysical methods, including:

- **Tully-Fisher relation** (for spiral galaxies)  
- **Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa)** (standard candles for cosmological distances)  
- **Cepheid Variables** (primary distance indicators)  
- **BL Lac luminosity** (AGN-based distance estimation)  

## ðŸ“Š Methods
The data has been compiled from observational surveys using the above techniques.  

## ðŸ“š References
Each entry is linked to its original astrophysical source, including **ApJ, ApJS, and AJ papers** from various astronomical surveys.  

## ðŸ”¬ Usage
This dataset is useful for researchers interested in:  
- Verifying the **Hubble constant (Hâ‚€)** using independent distance estimators  
- Investigating **cosmic expansion** models through gravitational friction effects  
- Cross-validating **distance-redshift relationships** for extragalactic objects
