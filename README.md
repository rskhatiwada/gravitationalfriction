# gravitationalfriction
This repository contains a text file presenting an analysis of the Hubble Law derived from first principles, exploring gravitational friction as a potential mechanism. The dataset comprises distance measurements obtained via different astrophysical methods, including Tully-Fisher relation, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Cepheid variables, and BL Lac luminosity.

Methods: Data compiled from observational surveys using:
Tully-Fisher relation (for spiral galaxies)
Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) (standard candles for cosmological distances)
Cepheid Variables (primary distance indicators)
BL Lac luminosity (AGN-based distance estimation)
ðŸ“š References: Each entry is linked to its original astrophysical source, including ApJ, ApJS, and AJ papers from various astronomical surveys.
Usage
This dataset is useful for researchers interested in:

Verifying the Hubble constant (Hâ‚€) using independent distance estimators
Investigating cosmic expansion models through gravitational friction effects
Cross-validating distance-redshift relationships for extragalactic objects
